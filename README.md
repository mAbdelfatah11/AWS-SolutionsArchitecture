# AWS Solutions Architecture

## Solution one: _Monolothic to Microservices solution_

![Image description](Solution1_MonolothicToMiroservices.png)
my solution architecture for breaking down a monolithic application into microservices utilizes several key AWS services, including the API Gateway, Lambda functions, Amazon Aurora, and AWS EventBridge. The API Gateway acts as the entry point for incoming requests, routing them to the appropriate Lambda function for processing. The Lambda functions, written in the language of your choice, handle the specific logic for each microservice. Amazon Aurora provides a fully managed relational database for storing data, while AWS EventBridge enables communication between the different microservices through the use of events. This architecture allows for greater scalability and flexibility in the development and deployment of our application.
